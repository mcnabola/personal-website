    <h1>Mark W McNabola</h1>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my corner of the web. I have just finished a BSc in Computer Systems (basically Comp Science) from the 
      University of Limerick. I will be starting a Graduate Software Engineering position at Cisco at Aug. '21, which I am looking forward too.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been programming since I was in 3rd year (?even earlier) of secondary school I cant even remember. Although it would have 
      been light programming back then, I aim to trace and document my journey of learning and progress up to where I am now in life. 
      I will also post my thoughts and interesting technology material here too in the form of blogs or journals, it all remains to 
      be seen.
    </p>

    <p>Now its time to deploy this website! Perfectionism / waiting until its 100% beautiful is a curse .. as much as its a positive.</p>
