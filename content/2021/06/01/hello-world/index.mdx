## My first post!!

I have finally after all of this time started the development of my 'proper' personal website. Looking forward to the adventure. I aim to document interesting phenomen and projects that I encounter. Along with making a permanent home on the internet.

In the process of building this blog I have had to test the features of adding code highlighting and adding images. Surely adding images would be easy its only an image tag. Well its a bit more complicated in this setup.


```js
const bigman = "first ever post";
console.log(bigman);
```
